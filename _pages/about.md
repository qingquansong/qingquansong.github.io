* I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.stanford.edu/) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I am working at the [DATA Lab](http://people.tamu.edu/~guangzhou92/Data_Lab/) under the supervision of [Prof. Xia (Ben) Hu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/students.html). 
* Before joining TAMU, I received my B.S. degree in Statistics at [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2016. 
* My research interests lie in the general area of data mining and machine learning, particularly in incremental learning and automated machine learning.
